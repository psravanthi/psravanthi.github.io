I spent my first week of Metis working on a project to analyze the movement of New Yorkers through MTA turnstile data. The objective was to help a hypothetical client, WTWY (WomenTechWomenYes) to increase attendance for their annual gala, build awareness, and to increase contributions. The client intends to place street teams at entrances to subway stations. The street teams collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to the gala. 

We focused on finding stations with most traffic, and the highest traffic day and time for the stations in order to maximize the reach. The code for the project can be found here.

The steps followed for the analysis are as follows:

* Data Extraction
* Data Cleansing
* Data Analysis/Visualization
* Recommendations
