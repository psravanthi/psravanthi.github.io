title: MTA New York Subway Traffic analysis
---

I spent my first week of Metis working on a project to analyze the movement of New Yorkers through MTA turnstile data. The objective was to help a hypothetical client, WTWY (WomenTechWomenYes) to increase attendance for their annual gala, build awareness, and to increase contributions. The client intends to place street teams at entrances to subway stations. The street teams collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to the gala.
